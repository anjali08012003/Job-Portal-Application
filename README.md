 Job Portal - Comprehensive Documentation

Project Title: Job Portal

Developed by: Anjali Mittal

## Overview

The Job Portal is an online platform that connects job seekers with potential employers in an efficient and streamlined manner. It is designed to cater to both applicants seeking jobs and companies looking to fill their vacancies with the right talent. The application features a responsive and user-friendly interface, offering both dark and light theme modes. Built with the latest technologies such as ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and MUI (Material-UI), this portal simplifies the job search process and enhances the recruitment experience.

The system is structured following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for better maintainability and scalability, leveraging High Order Components (HOC) for modularity and code reuse. The job portal also includes advanced features like JWT-based authentication, user role management, job searching and filtering, and a dynamic admin dashboard for managing the entire platform.

### Purpose

This platform aims to:
- Provide job seekers with an easy-to-navigate portal where they can search, apply for jobs, and track their application history.
- Enable employers to post jobs, manage categories, and monitor analytics regarding job applications and user engagement.
- Ensure a secure, responsive, and user-friendly experience, regardless of device type or theme preference.
